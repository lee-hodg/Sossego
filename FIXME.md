# TODO

- Unit tests (re-watch vids and add as go)


# FIXME

- Meditation bell audio stutters (OK on real phone)

- My reminders seem to have more than 1 time per day???

- Why do the rain drops not totally position off screen in meditation animation?

- If quickly toggle the time intervals sometimes errors?

- Sometimes it seems the bell rings at end of time even if alarm was supposed to be cancelled.

- If app already open and click the notification koin crashes app sometimes

- The streak count tracking is it robust or not?

- - Should I add glide, plus pics with loading spinner to fulfil some of rubric? Journal entries could have a photo
for example, but ugh storage...maybe will wait until they hard complain on that

# FUTURE

- I could extend the journal model w/ public share, admin approved fields.
Then we let the user opt in his journal entry and admin ticks approve initially.
We then have a feed recycler view with the same journal entries, the firebase rules are extended to allow read on
anything public ticked and we fetch and sort by date the ones ticked, detail view would be read-only textbox, no save/no delete, just a big textbox
