Sossego features gratitude lists, journaling, configurable reminders and an adjustable meditation timer.
The hope is that Sossego will be useful for people wishing to generate more peace and mindfulness in their lives and help addicts
in recovery completing programs that involve such practices. These practices can also
be useful in achieving all kinds of goals from business to success to weight-loss.


## Development

Sossego is a free, open-source Android app writen in Kotlin.
